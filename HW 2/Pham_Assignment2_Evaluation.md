Task 1: 
ELIZA is vulnerable to ambiguity since it cannot handle open-ended or rhetorical questions. For instance, asking, "Can you respond to this question?" or "What if I don't say anything?" normally results in generic cues like "Why do you ask?" or "Say more." These responses illustrate the inability of ELIZA to discern the intent of the questions. It lacks the depth to engage in a meaningful conversation, as it is merely a pattern-matching response without comprehension.

Self-referential statements also create an issue. When confronted with statements like, "I don't think that you are a chatbot" or "What would you say if I told you you don't make sense? " ELIZA responds with diversions like, "Why do you say that?" or "Tell me more." Instead of handling the self-referential nature of the statement, ELIZA interprets it literally and does not process or understand the idea behind it. This illustrates the limitations of ELIZA's approach, which lacks real reasoning ability. In complex sentence structures, ELIZA's limitations are even more apparent. Sentences with multi-layered ideas such as "Do you think my thoughts are my own, or do they represent the world that surrounds me?" tend to draw irrelevant or shallow replies.

ELIZA's response will thus be on the level of keywords and not consider the complexity or depth of the utterance. This reiterates the point that ELIZA's pattern-matching system is most effective with simple, direct sentences, and degrades when the conversation is more subtle or indirect. Task 2: Evaluating ELIZA's Responses â€“ Person Deixis, World Knowledge, and Logical Consistency Something ELIZA does better is in handling person deixis, or the use of pronouns within a conversation.

For instance, if you type, "I feel sad," ELIZA rightly responds with "Why do you feel sad? " If you type, "You are not very helpful," it switches the pronouns and responds with "Why do you say I am not very helpful? " This implies that ELIZA can handle straightforward first and second-person pronoun conversions. When person deixis is used in indirect speech or embedded clauses, ELIZA struggles.

For example, "My friend said I should talk to you" leads to a muddled response like, "Tell me more about your friend." In this case, ELIZA fails to switch the pronouns correctly, showing that although it can handle simple deixis, it cannot handle more complex use. In world knowledge, ELIZA's response is always bad. If you ask a fact-based question like, "What is the capital of France?" or "Do you know what a chatbot is?" ELIZA's response will increasingly be "Why do you ask?" rather than an informational one.The program lacks any real world knowledge outside the predetermined patterns it has been programmed with. This is due to the fact that ELIZA cannot respond to fact-based questions, but instead diverts the conversation in a way that does not reply to the question at all.

Logical consistency is another area where ELIZA's limitations are apparent. If you type, "I always lie," ELIZA fails to recognize the logical contradiction in the statement. Instead, it says "Tell me more," with no engagement with the paradox. Similarly, when presented with a sentence like, "If I'm saying that I'm not speaking, am I speaking?" ELIZA responds with "Can you elaborate on that?" without catching the self-contradiction. This demonstrates that ELIZA doesn't engage in any logical reasoning. It relies on its preestablished response patterns, never observing or commenting on logical contradictions within the conversation.
