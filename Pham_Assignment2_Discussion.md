In solving the earlier tasks, understanding English syntax and morphology played a huge role, especially in handling person deixis. English marks first and second person clearly with pronouns like I, you, me, my, your, and verb conjugations like am, are, was, were. Transforming statements required attention to subject-verb agreement and possessive forms. For example, switching "I am happy" to "You are happy" involves both a pronoun change and a verb shift. Contracted forms like I'm and you're added another layer of complexity, demanding precise transformations to maintain grammatical correctness.

Building an ELIZA-like chatbot in English is relatively straightforward because English follows a predictable subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. Unlike highly inflected languages such as Russian or Turkish, where verb endings change based on tense, mood, and subject, English has minimal inflectional variation. This makes regex-based transformations easier. However, in languages with richer morphology, like Finnish, where case endings modify words extensively, or Japanese, where context often determines meaning rather than word order, replicating ELIZA’s pattern-matching approach would be much harder. A bot in those languages would need deeper syntactic analysis and more advanced natural language processing to sound natural.

Regular expressions work well for simple pattern recognition, but they have serious limitations when modeling human language. They shine when identifying specific words or structures, making them great for replacing pronouns or swapping word orders. However, they struggle with complex or ambiguous inputs. A sentence like "I wonder if you think I am happy" requires more than basic substitution—it needs contextual understanding. Regex-based bots can’t grasp meaning or adjust responses dynamically, leading to awkward or nonsensical replies. More advanced approaches, like parsing trees and machine learning, are needed for chatbots to move beyond parroting words and actually engage in meaningful conversation.
