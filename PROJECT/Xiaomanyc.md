Don't listen bestie, they're just salty because their language game is dogwater. being multilingual is OD, letting you stan cultures, vibe with international fam, and utterly mog your career. No cap, speaking another language let's you go off turning you into an absolute conversational rizzlord. So yeah chat, thats the sauce.
