If we have a yield of the applied rules of a CFG grammar, the order of the rules can be re-constructed via _parsing_ the sequence, and a **CYK parser** (Cocke, Younger and Kasami) is a parser efficiently assigning structures to sentences. Additionally, we discuss complexity characterization of algorithms in terms of **Big O notation**."

    "  * **Step 3.** FILLING ROW 3. Now, consider all $3$-grams of the sequence, for example, \"eats a fish\". It can correspond to two possible parses: either \"eats; a fish\", or \"eats a; fish\". \"eats; a fish\" corresponds to the possible tags of \"V,VP\" and \"NP\", i.e. either \"V NP\" or \"VP NP\". \"V NP\" can in fact be generated by \"VP\", so we fill \"VP\" in the corresponding table. The other option \"eats a; fish\" yields no possible parses.\n",
    "  * **Step 4.** FILLING ROW 4. Later, $4$-grams are considered, i.e. we look at possible parses of sequences \"she; eats a fish\", \"she eats; a fish\" and \"she eats a; fish\", etc. Again, fill the cell with all possible ways to construct the corresponding $4$-grams.\n",
    "  * **Step 5.** Finally, after all the rows are processed, the parse was assigned if the unique starting symbol is present in the upper left corner. If it is not there, this sequence cannot be parsed."
