The **NLTK tokenizer** leaves punctuation in as individual tokens but nevertheless splits contractions in a capricious fashion, improving structure without deep linguistic awareness. The **spaCy tokenizer** is the most advanced, keeping punctuation and handling most contractions nicely, though it misinterprets `\\\\\\\"overturn'd;nor\\\\\\\"` by combining tokens inappropriately. **RegEx** is adequate for straightforward word counting, **NLTK** strikes the ideal balance of structure and simplicity, and **spaCy** provides the most natural-sounding sentence structure but overdoes it in complicated scenarios. It all depends on the NLP task—regex for basic word retrieval, NLTK for structured text, and spaCy for deep linguistic processing."

    "The highest mutual information values are for word pairs like \"afric shore\" and \"ancient gentlewoman,\" which shows that these words strongly depend on each other. These word pairs are rare but meaningful, so their relationship is more significant than common words like \"the\" or \"and.\" Lower values would be from words that are frequent but without any profound association. Mutual information is better than conditional probability because it shows important word relationships rather than just how often one word follows the other. Conditional probability is therefore useful in finding important phrases in a text and not just common ordinary word patterns."

    "I think I worked well at contrasting the tokenization methods and their results. It was simple to contrast differences among regular expressions, NLTK, and spaCy when looking at how they handled punctuation and contractions. The most difficult part was the interpretation of mutual information values and giving explanations for why certain pairs of words had high scores. More critical thinking was required than a simple comparison of token counts to know why these relations were present. On the other hand, identifying the biggest points of contention between tokenizers was easier than expected because the patterns stood out in the output."
